Encode &amp; Decode the message using Caesar-Cipher technique.


What is Caesar - Cipher technique?
The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet.
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence


Example: IF we do a rotation of 3 places.
